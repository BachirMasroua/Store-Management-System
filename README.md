# Store Management System

## Description

This C# Windows Form Store Management System was developed as an object-oriented programming project. It is an easy-to-use system for managing a store's inventory, customers, orders and other related data.

The system allows users to view and update a store's Products, create new customers and orders and view the store's sales history. It also provides various reports, such as the total sales of all customers in a certain period.

The system provides an intuitive user interface and makes it easy to find the information users need.

This Store Management System is an excellent tool for managing a store's data, and it provides users with the necessary features to do so.

There is always room for improvement and to add new features. I'm eager to explore what possibilities the future may hold and am open to implementing them.
